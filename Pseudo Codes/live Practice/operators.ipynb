    "#### Key Points to Remember: \n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "    - Higher precedence operators are evaluated before lower precedence operators. \n",
    "    - Associalvity determines the order of evalualon when operators of the same precedence appear in an expression. \n",
    "        o Len-to-Right Associalvity: Operators are evaluated from the lenmost side. \n",
    "        o Right-to-Len Associalvity: Operators are evaluated from the rightmost side. \n",
    "    - Parentheses () can be used to override precedence and force the evalualon order you desire. \n",

    "**Operator Categories:** \n",
