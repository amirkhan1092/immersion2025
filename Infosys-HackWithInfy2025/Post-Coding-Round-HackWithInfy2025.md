Progression to the next stages based on scores, test cases passed, and code efficiency.
Selection Criteria After Round 1	Top performers in Round 1.	Evaluation of performance in the coding test.	Top 100 participants qualify for the Grand Finale. Others may be considered for SP/DSE roles interviews.
Round 2: Grand Finale (Hackathon)	Top 100 participants from Round 1.	A 4-day team-based hackathon in August 2025. Infosys forms the teams and covers travel and accommodation.	Opportunity for cash prizes and pre-placement interviews for Power Programmer or System Engineer roles.
Interview Round (for other qualified participants)	Candidates who performed well in Round 1 but did not qualify for the Grand Finale.	Assesses technical and behavioral skills, including core CS subjects, algorithms, data structures, and project details. May involve coding challenges and HR questions.	Successful candidates receive job offers for roles such as System Engineer, Digital Specialist Programmer, and Specialist Programmer.

Infosys Technical and Behavioural Interview
If students are progressing to the Infosys Technical and Behavioral Interview round (whether for SP/DSE/SES roles or after the HackWithInfy Grand Finale), a structured approach to preparation is crucial. Infosys assesses candidates not just on technical prowess but also on their personality, communication skills, and fit within the company's culture
Here's a comprehensive guide to help students excel:
1. Technical Interview Preparation
•	Focus on Core Computer Science Fundamentals: Infosys places a strong emphasis on core CS concepts, so students should have a solid grasp of:
o	Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): This is a key area. Ensure they understand concepts like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. They should also be familiar with algorithms like sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort), searching (e.g., Binary Search), and potentially dynamic programming and greedy algorithms, PrepInsta.
o	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Master OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, providing real-world examples to illustrate their understanding.
o	Database Management Systems (DBMS): Cover topics like SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), different types of joins, database design concepts (normalization), and potentially differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
o	Operating Systems (OS) and Computer Networks (CN): Familiarize themselves with basic OS concepts (e.g., process management, memory management) and networking fundamentals (e.g., TCP/UDP differences, IP addressing).
•	Programming Language Proficiency: While Infosys accepts various languages like C, C++, Java, and Python, PrepInsta, encourage students to choose the language they are most comfortable with and practice coding in it. They should be able to write basic programs and explain the logic and syntax involved, Great Learning.
•	Hands-on Experience: Working on projects and internships is highly valued. Encourage students to build projects (e.g., a library management system) and be able to articulate their contributions and the technologies used, YouTube.
•	Problem-Solving and Logical Reasoning: Be prepared to solve aptitude-based questions, puzzles, and coding problems that assess problem-solving skills, PrepInsta.
•	Stay Updated on Industry Trends: Research Infosys's recent projects and areas of focus like AI, cloud computing, and data analytics, upGrad. This demonstrates genuine interest and can give an edge in interviews, Foundit.in. 
2. Behavioral/HR Interview Preparation
•	"Tell Me About Yourself": This common opening question requires a concise introduction covering education, achievements, projects, skills, and strengths. This is an opportunity to set a positive tone and spark further discussion.
•	Strengths and Weaknesses: Provide honest answers supported by examples. Align strengths with the job role and showcase how weaknesses are being addressed.
•	"Why Infosys?": Research Infosys's values, projects, and work culture. Articulate how personal goals align with the company's vision. Mentioning the company's reputation for innovation or career development can be effective.
•	Situational and Behavioral Questions: These assess problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution skills. Encourage students to prepare real-life examples and use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure answers.
•	Career Goals: Discussing career aspirations for the next 5-10 years shows foresight and commitment.
•	Communication Skills: Effective communication is highly valued. Students should practice speaking clearly, listening actively, and asking insightful questions.
•	Resume/CV Review: Ensure resumes are well-structured, highlighting relevant skills and accomplishments with quantifiable metrics where possible. They should be prepared to discuss every aspect of their resume in detail. 
3. General Interview Tips
•	Mock Interviews: Conduct mock interviews with peers or mentors to simulate real interview conditions, build confidence, and receive feedback.
•	Professional Appearance and Body Language: Advise students on appropriate attire and the importance of positive body language and eye contact.
•	Positive Mindset: Encourage a confident and calm approach. It's better to admit not knowing an answer than to bluff.
•	Ask Thoughtful Questions: At the end, students should ask questions about the role, team, or company to demonstrate engagement and interest.
By focusing on these areas and encouraging consistent practice, you can significantly enhance the chances of success in the Infosys interview process
