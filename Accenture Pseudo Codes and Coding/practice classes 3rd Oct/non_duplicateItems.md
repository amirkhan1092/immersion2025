Here’s the updated coding problem statement focusing on finding a single non-duplicate item in an array of integers, where all other elements appear twice:

### Problem Statement

**Problem**: Given an array of integers, find the single element that appears only once while all other elements appear exactly twice. You can assume that there is exactly one such element in the array.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer `N` (the number of elements in the array).
- The second line contains `N` integers representing the elements of the array.

### Output Format
- Print the integer that is the non-duplicate item.

### Example

**Input**:
```
7
4 1 2 1 2 3 4
```

**Output**:
```
3
```

### Explanation
In the provided example:
- The input array is `[4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- The number `3` appears exactly once, while all other numbers appear twice, so the output is `3`.

### Approach to Solve the Problem

1. **Use XOR Operation**: The XOR operation can be leveraged here because:
   - `x ^ x = 0` (any number XORed with itself is 0)
   - `x ^ 0 = x` (any number XORed with 0 is the number itself)
   - Therefore, XORing all the numbers together will cancel out the pairs and leave only the single non-duplicate item.

### Implementation

Here’s how you can implement this logic in Python:

```python
def find_single_non_duplicate(n, arr):
    # Step 1: Initialize result variable
    result = 0
    
    # Step 2: Perform XOR on all elements
    for num in arr:
        result ^= num
    
    return result

# Example Input
n = 7
arr = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Output the result
result = find_single_non_duplicate(n, arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array, as we iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use only a constant amount of extra space for the result.

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently finds the single non-duplicate item in an array where every other element appears exactly twice. If you have any further questions or need additional examples, feel free to ask!
