### **Accenture Coding Preparation Cheat Sheet**

#### **1. Arrays**
- **Common Operations:**
  - Access, update, insert, delete elements
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
  - Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)

  
- **Common Problems:**
  - Find missing number in an array
  - Find the largest/smallest element
  - Subarray with given sum
  - Stock market

#### **2. Strings**
- **Common Operations:**
  - Length of string, reverse string, substring, concatenation
  - Palindrome check
  - Anagram check

- **Common Problems:**
  - Longest Common Subsequence
  - Count vowels and consonants
  - Remove duplicates from a string

#### **3. Data Structures**
- **Stack:**
  - Use for LIFO operations (Last In First Out)
  - Implementation using arrays or linked lists
  - Common problems: Valid parentheses, evaluate postfix expression
  
- **Queue:**
  - Use for FIFO operations (First In First Out)
  - Circular queue, deque implementation
  - Common problems: Implement a queue using two stacks, sliding window problem

- **Linked List:**
  - Singly and doubly linked list operations
  - Insert, delete, reverse, detect cycles
  - Common problems: Reverse a linked list, find the middle of a linked list

#### **4. Sorting and Searching**
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Time complexity comparison
  - Quick Sort (O(n log n) average case)
  - Merge Sort (O(n log n))
  
- **Binary Search:**
  - Efficient for sorted arrays
  - Problem examples: Find element in rotated sorted array, first and last occurrence of a number

#### **5. Recursion**
- **Common Problems:**
  - Factorial, Fibonacci sequence
  - Tower of Hanoi
  - Backtracking problems[Optional]: N-Queens, Maze solving

#### **6. Dynamic Programming**
- **Common Problems:**
  - Knapsack problem
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence
  - Coin change problem

- **DSA Concepts:**
  - Time Complexity: O(1), O(n), O(log n)
  - Space Complexity considerations


  

  
#### **7. Coding Environment Tips**
- Read the problem statement carefully.
- Plan the algorithm and approach before coding.
- Write clean and modular code.
- Optimize for time and space.
